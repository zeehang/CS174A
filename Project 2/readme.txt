The program starts after three seconds to allow all assets to load.

This scene takes place at the White House. The scene goes through some establishing exterior shots, and cuts inside where we see Donald Trump tweeting about Lavar Ball. Unfortunately for Donald, Lavar happens to be in the Oval Office and is not happy!

Look_at() is used to track Trump walking across the Oval Office, as well as the many types of camera shots/pans in the scene. Look_at() is also used to track Trump flying out of the White House. Trump flying out the white house also simulates physics by using the projectile motion equation.

Iâ€™ve created a custom pyramid shape which is used to build the trees shown in the exterior shots of the White House (the pyramids are textured with the colors of fall foliage).

Frame rate is displayed in the control panel.
